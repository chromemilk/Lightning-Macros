The best universal cheat alternative (UNDETECTED)
</h4>

<p align="center">
This is a soon-to-be paid universal macro made using Dear ImGui and C++

## Problems?

**Isnt working?** -> Try restarting the macro

---

Start the macro after you start the game so the anti-recoil is able to sync with the game

Pros & Cons
</h3>

<h3>Pros</h3>

- Undetectable
- Easy to use
- Works on every game

<h3>Cons</h3>

- Relies on raw math instead of data-assisted math (unable to process game data for use in anti-recoil and relies on user input; eliminates a RCS)
- Pixelbot relies on RGB values and won't work in dark games

<h3 align="center">
How to compile
</h3>

- Download the zip file or clone the repository 
- Make sure your C++ standard is on C++ 20
- Have the icon on your desktop or change the location in the resource.h file
- Set your project to "release" x86
- Click the green arrow or build the solution
- **This applies to BOTH the launcher and the macro solutions**
